Potabi Source Control
=====================

### ***An SCM that makes sense***

### For those not familar with how SCMs work.
Source Control Managers (SCM for short) are applications that help software engineers - especially in open-source software feilds - manage software development with multiple users.

## PSC Reference:
PSC runs commands in a specific order in one-line operations, which are an option because no one wants to run three commands that could easily be done in one. Here is a basic commit & push command with PSC: `psc commit <directory> "<message>" push`.

## Notice
PSC is still early-development software that is currently only a Git overlay as a Python script. We wish to do more with the project in the near future, but for now PSC is a very minimal source control program.
